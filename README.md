#### INTRODUCTION
The purpose of this analysis is to leverage data analytics and machine learning techniques to predict future sales trends. Accurate sales forecasting is crucial for businesses to optimize inventory management, enhance customer satisfaction, and improve overall financial performance. In this project, we will explore various methodologies, including time series analysis and regression models, to analyze historical sales data and generate reliable forecasts. The insights gained from this project will empower stakeholders to make informed decisions and strategically plan for the future.
The sales forecasting data includes several key columns: 
1. Date: This column records the specific date for each sales entry, allowing us to analyze trends over time.
2. Sales: This represents the total number of units sold on that particular date, serving as the primary variable we aim to forecast.
3. OnPromotion: This column indicates whether the products were on promotion during the recorded date, which can significantly impact sales figures.
4. Family: This refers to the category or family of products, helping to segment sales data and analyze trends across different product types.
